# John Lewis Coding Challenge 21, part 2

<https://coding-challenges.jl-engineering.net/challenges/challenge-21/>

Solving Sudokus again, this time using (more) recursion. This algorithm
generates lists of possible boards by making deductions and guessing based on
the previous list, until all boards have been verified as either valid
solutions, or invalid.

This solution improves on the previous one by generating all solutions for a
puzzle (I think).
